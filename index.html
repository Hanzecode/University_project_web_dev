    <!-- Paragraph describing purpose of festival -->
    <p>
      This festival is designed specifically for university students, offering them a much-needed opportunity to unwind and recharge after a long, demanding semester. 
      Throughout the academic year, students face intense workloads, tight deadlines, and constant pressure to perform, which can leave them feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. 
      The festival serves as a refreshing break from that routine, providing a welcoming and stress-free environment where they can simply be themselves. 
      More than just a celebration, the event creates a space for students to relax, connect with friends, and build new relationships with peers they may not have met otherwise. 
      It encourages community, camaraderie, and a sense of belonging—reminding students that they're part of a larger, supportive campus culture. 
      Whether they choose to enjoy the entertainment, participate in activities, or just take a moment to breathe, the festival gives them a chance to celebrate all the hard work, dedication, and perseverance 
      they've shown throughout the semester. Ultimately, it's a moment for students to reflect on everything they've accomplished, recharge their energy, and head into the next term feeling refreshed, motivated, and appreciated.
